# Database

Design an EER schema for a database application that you are interested in. Specify all constraints that should hold on the database. Make sure that the schema has five entity types, four relationship types, a weak entity type, a superclass/subclass relationship, a category, and an n-ary (n > 2) relationship type.

The assignment is very generic. The students are welcome to choose whichever scenario they are interested in, say (a) library management system, (b) social security management system, (c) DMV system, etc. Since my class comprises both Undergrad and Grad students, I am dividing my assessment strategy for the assignment given below among these two classes of students.


For Undergrad students:
This assignment will test their general knowledge about how government organizations (SSN and DMV), and University centers (like library) function â€“ like who are the clients, what are the different types of clients, what attributes of the clients need to be analyzed, how do we share data, how do we manage data, how do we interpret data, which data could be sensitive that it needs to be protected, how do you keep track of data records, how do you update data systematically, how data can be searched, how data can be compared, when machine learning methods can be incorporated, how artificial intelligence can be used, what are outliers, etc.


For Graduate students:
This assignment will test their knowledge in searching data and doing research about finding the right type of model that could fit real-time data in real-world scenarios, interactions between various entities in the model, which database tools can be learnt and used to search, present and compare past data with present data, and using this information to perform data prediction. Curve fitting, prediction, smoothening, averaging, data conciliation, filtering outliers, finding correlation between data observed in a period of a few days or hours or minutes, are all techniques used commonly these days in data management systems. Designing a data model is also a part of the assessment process.
